Recursion -> Make decision which will lead to input smaller 
            means our primary goal is to take a certain decision which will lead us to 
            SECONDARY GOAL:- of recusrion which is making input smaller.

Recusrion -> Decision space

Choice smajh ke decision lena hai (It is Recursion)

Recursive tree then go to the code


How to identify that its a Recusrive Problem:-
                Kya kya choices ha unke basis pe decisons kya lena hai 
                Kya choice thi or kya decision liya usse inout chota hua 


Example Subset Problem:-
Example 'abc'
    Choices:-       
            a b c null (choices)
            decisons mere kya hoge? Kon kon sa letter/null lena hai 

            Like :- a ,b ,c,ab, bc, abc, null
            decisons leta gya input chota hota gya 

Recursive Tree:-

                ""        -> Input = "abc"
            /    |     \     \
          "a"   "b"    "c"   ""   (choices)
         / | \    /|\    /|\    /|\
      "ab" "ac" "a" ... and so on               (decisions taken here)

Input chota hota gya or base case pe pahuch gya

Input output method to make Recursive tree:-
