What is Thread? 
    A thread is a smallest unit of execution inside a process.

java program = process

Why Threads? 
    Without threads multiple fuction will run one at a time or the task will get perform one at a time
    But , with treads it runs at same time 
    Due to which app becomes faster  scalable

👉 Threads give concurrency(Multiple tasks making progress (time slicing)) :- Single Core CUP
👉 Multi-core CPUs give parallelism:- Tasks run at same time :- Multi Core CPU eack core run task parallely

Java don’t run threads , it only creates threads
OS decides when to pause , when to restart 

THREAD CREATION
    1. Extends Thread class
    2. Implement Runnable interface ( Prefrred as it offers loose coupling , multiple inheritance)

1. Extends Thread class
Limitation:- No multiple inheritance

    public class MyThread extends Threads {
        static void run(){
            System.out.println("Thread is running...")
        }
    }


    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Mythread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();

        // You override run()
        // You call start(), not run()
        // start() → creates a new thread
        // JVM internally calls run()
        //if we call run directly it behaves like a normal method.
    }

2. Implement Runnable interface
    class MyTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task running");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyTask());
        t.start();
    }
}



What is Thread Priority?
    It is the hint to OS scheduler to tell the priority of the thread
        Thread.MIN_PRIORITY  = 1
        Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5  // default
        Thread.MAX_PRIORITY  = 10

    Priority does not gurantee the execution order , it is only suggestion



What does sleep() do?
    Pauses the current thread for a given time.

    Key points:-

        sleep() is static
        Always affects the current running thread   

        Used for:
            delays
            retries
            simulations


What is Race Condition? 
    Race condition happens when multiple threads access or modify shared data at the same time 
    Shared data + multiple threads + no control = bug

        Key condition for race condition

            All three must be true:
                1️ Shared variable
                2️ Multiple threads  
                3️ At least one thread modifies data

        Remove any one → no race condition.

Solution:-
1. Synchronized method

    synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

2. Synchronized Block
        void increment() {
        synchronized(this) {
            //critical section
            count++;
        }
    }

What is “critical section”?

The part of code that accesses shared data and must not be executed by 
multiple threads simultaneously.


        NEW
        ↓ start()
        RUNNABLE
        ↓ waiting for lock
        BLOCKED
        ↓ gets lock
        RUNNABLE
        ↓ sleep()/wait()
        WAITING / TIMED_WAITING
        ↓ done
        TERMINATED

            One-line explanations (memorize)

            NEW → thread created

            RUNNABLE → ready or running

            BLOCKED → waiting for lock

            WAITING → waiting indefinitely

            TIMED_WAITING → waiting for fixed time

            TERMINATED → finished execution
